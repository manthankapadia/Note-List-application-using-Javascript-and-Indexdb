# Note-List-application-using-Javascript-and-Indexdb
Create a single page HTML5 application for taking a list of notes. This single HTML page will open in the browser and all interactions will happen in the same page with JavaScript, the browser itself should never have to refresh/reload the page. The data from the note list will be persistent between loads using a local browser storage API.
